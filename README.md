# Predicting_Rent
A real estate agent wants to estimate the market rate for some apartments in NYC that just went into the market again. They want to use the data posted by the Census in 2014:

(The data is at https://www.census.gov/housing/nychvs/data/2014/uf_14_occ_web_b.txt)

Create and validate a machine learning approach to predict the monthly rent of an apartment.
Make sure to only use features that apply to pricing an apartment that is not currently rented. You can make the simplifying assumption that the market doesnâ€™t increase, so the rent for a new tenant would be the same as for the current tenant.

Explain how you validated your model and why.

Report the test error using R^2 and any other metric you deem appropriate.

Limit yourself to linear models for the prediction (though feature engineering, feature selection and imputation methods are allowed). Ensembles  of models are not allowed.
